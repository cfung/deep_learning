**Project 1: "Your first neural network"** - Build and train your own Neural Network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.

**Project 2: "Image Classification"** - Classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a convolutional neural network.

**Project 3: "Generate TV scripts"** - Use deep learning to generate new scripts for your favorite TV show.

**Project 4: "Translate a Language"** - Translate from one language to another

**Project 5: "Generate Faces"** - Compete two neural networks against each other to generate realistic faces.
